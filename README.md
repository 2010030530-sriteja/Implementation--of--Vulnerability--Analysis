# Implementation--of--Vulnerability--Analysis



Vulnerability Testing also called Vulnerability Assessment is a process of evaluating security risks in software systems to reduce the probability of threats. The purpose of vulnerability testing is reducing the possibility for intruders/hackers to get unauthorized access of systems. It depends on the mechanism named Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing(VAPT) or VAPT testing.
A vulnerability is any mistake or weakness in the system’s security procedures, design, implementation or any internal control that may result in the violation of the system’s security policy.

Types of a vulnerability scanner

Host Based
Identifies the issues in the host or the system.
The process is carried out by using host-based scanners and diagnose the vulnerabilities.
The host-based tools will load a mediator software onto the target system; it will trace the event and report it to the security analyst.
Network-Based
It will detect the open port, and identify the unknown services running on these ports. Then it will disclose possible vulnerabilities associated with these services.
This process is done by using Network-based Scanners.
Database-Based
It will identify the security exposure in the database systems using tools and techniques to prevent from SQL Injections. (SQL Injections: – Injecting SQL statements into the database by the malicious users, which can read the sensitive data’s from a database and can update the data in the Database.
